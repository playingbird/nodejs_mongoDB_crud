# Nodejs-Mongodb-CRUD
In this repository, I have created CRUD operation sites using Nodejs as backend with Nosql database.

# what you need to use
You have to use nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, ejs, css etc.
Generally, here we are just letting the admin add, delete or update the user i.e to perform CRUD operation using NoSql.

# Level
Basic
It is very simple and important projects of nodejs and mongodb.
So you can add this app in your resume as well.

# How to use this code on your projects
You can simply download every files from github and after that you have to install npm and have to download all the dependencies listed in package.json file
Why i need to download further stuffs?
=because nodemodules folder can't be uploaded in github and as you know it stores all the dependencies inside .
